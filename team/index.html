            <p>
              Leo has been involved in the construction business since
              graduating from the University of Idaho. One of his first projects
              after graduating was designing and building an off-grid cabin and
              year-round greenhouse for a client in McCall, Idaho.
              <br />
              Leo manages the finances and billing for Kai. He will work with
              you to establish an estimate at the start of your project. As
              selections are made, he will keep you apprised of where your
              actual budget is compared to the estimate that was determined at
              the start of the project. He is also our point person managing the
              bids from our subs. Leo will meet with you regularly to keep you
              up to date with the actual cost of your project.
              <br />
              In his free time, he enjoys trail running and working on his van.
              We are all anxious to see what the finished result will be!

              When Drew is not working on his own house or with his family, he
              is likely off on an adventure… hiking, kayaking, rafting or on his
              adventure bike.

            <h3>Gary Stott</h3>
            <h4>Field Carpenter</h4>
            <p>
              A resident of Boise since 1998. Gary was born and lived in Eugene,
              OR. He was raised a Beaver (OSU) and graduated a Duck (U of O)
              with a degree in Rhetoric &amp; Communication. From 1980 -2013 he
              never ventured far from the outdoor industry having worked in such
              capacities as fishing guide, kayak instructor, and GM/VP of a
              retail/wholesale and mail order business.
              <br />
              For the past two decades Gary along with his wife Lynn have
              operated Stott Design PRM, a twofold operation of renovating
              residential properties for resale and performing property
              management duties for both residential and commercial properties.
              <br />
              Gary's work with Kai Homes the past 6 years has been primarily as
              a field carpenter performing all sorts of duties that tie into a
              finished product. A proud contributor to the Kai Team, he works
              closely with the project manager and client support manager. He
              loves to play and travel and most of his adventures center around
              biking, running, fishing and river trips.

            <h3>Mark Joffe</h3>
            <h4>Owner/Manager</h4>
            <p>
              Mark Joffe's path to building high-end custom homes in Boise's
              most cherished urban and historic neighborhoods started far from
              the job site—on the wild rivers of the world. As a former
              international whitewater guide, Mark learned how to lead people
              through unfamiliar terrain with confidence, trust, and clear
              communication. Those same principles now guide every home he
              builds.
              <br />
              Today, Mark is the founder and hands-on general contractor behind
              Kai, a custom homebuilding company that specializes in thoughtful,
              design-driven construction in Boise's established neighborhoods.
              Whether it's restoring a century-old home or crafting a modern
              infill project that respects the fabric of the block, Mark brings
              a deep respect for architectural heritage and a sharp eye for
              detail to every project.
              <br />
              At the core of his work is a commitment to transparency,
              listening, and relationship- building. Mark believes that great
              homes are built on trust as much as they are on craftsmanship—and
              that the process should be as rewarding as the final product.
              <br />
              If you're looking to build or remodel a home in Boise's North End,
              East End, or any of the city's historic neighborhoods, Mark and
              the Kai team are here to guide you through - every step of the
              way.
